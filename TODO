+ Failed uploads don't seem to want to be deleted properly
# The error notification email has attachment called failed_uploads.csv
# For example, it contained a recording successfully uploaded and processed 
# but un-deleted on BB and un-renamed on PPTO

+ Add bit to manual run enabling to run on single course instead of all 
# Functionality already implemented

+ Failure case: folder<>course_id saved in file but folder is actually gone from panopto. What then? 
# folderName_folderId_pairs.json contains the PPTO folders matched with the respective course labels
# The json file is updated with new mappings as new items at each run when it searches the PPTO folders 
# Items are never removed but only added. We end up with legacy mappings if the folder is gone from PPTO
# Failure: eligible recordings should be migrated to a PPTO folder that was deleted in error
